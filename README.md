# Vector-Java
The vector class from C++ imported into Java. Place the extract in a directory named /Vector. To use the class import vector.java.
It has two methods -> push() and pop()

I) The push(int x) method initializes the x number to the end of the vector
II) The pop(int index) method removes the element at the index provided.

The vector can be constructed in the following manner ->
I) vector zool = new vector();
II) vector zool = new vector(0, 90); // assign 0 90 times to the vector
III) vector zool = new vector(1, 2, 3, 4);
